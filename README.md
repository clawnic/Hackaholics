# Project Name : SafeFrame


This project aims to enhance the clarity of images and videos in real-time by addressing the challenges of hazy or low-contrast scenes. Leveraging advanced machine learning models and computer vision techniques, our solution provides a sophisticated yet efficient way to dehaze and brighten visual content, ensuring a clearer and more vibrant viewing experience.

## Features


> Real-time Processing: 
Enjoy instant enhancement of both images and videos without compromising on performance. Our model operates efficiently to provide immediate results.

> Dehazing Algorithm: 
The underlying dehazing algorithm intelligently removes haze, fog, or low-contrast elements from the visual content, revealing hidden details and improving overall visibility.

> Brightening Enhancement: 
Enhance the brightness of the images and videos to ensure optimal visibility even in challenging lighting conditions.
